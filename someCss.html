        <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
            I've played soccer for as long as I can remember. My mom jokes that I must've been kicking a ball around in the womb. The first time I ever played competitively was U6 AYSO when I was a measly 4 year old. The other kids were much bigger and stronger than me, but I had far superior technical skill and still managed to crush all of them. Once I realized the raw soccer talent I had, I became heavily immersed in the sport.

        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            Once I got to high school, my love for playing soccer had faded a little. I think the reason for this was my realization that I wasn't going to play at the highest level. During my elementary and middle school years, I still had the dream of playing soccer professionally. Although I thought by high school that I was definitely good enough to play in college, I knew that I was never making it to the pros. That realization was part of the reason that I ended up quitting club soccer during my junior year.
